the differences are mostly visible on skintones since thats where banding shows up the most usually, debanding can be adjusted to liking but it should be fine as is  

SMSM does work with this preset, in very very bright scenarios like the one showcased here it might be slightly overexposed vs just vanilla but turning off HDR.fx or editing it a bit in photoshop or something like that should give better images overall than without SMSM by the simple fact that it has far better tone mapping and dithering than the unmodified game does

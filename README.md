[malkovichphoto-real](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade-Presets/blob/master/FFXIV/GShade/MalkovichPhoto-real.ini) is pretty good but on my pc it has a tendency to introduce a lot of banding as well as other visual oddities  
this modified preset tries to alleviate these issues on top of having very slight changes that i personally like

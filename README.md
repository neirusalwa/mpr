[malkovichphoto-real](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade-Presets/blob/master/FFXIV/GShade/MalkovichPhoto-real.ini) is pretty good but on my pc it has a tendency to introduce a lot of banding as well as other visual oddities  
this modified preset tries to alleviate these issues on top of having very slight changes that i personally like  

provided as is, no credits required  

examples are found [here](https://github.com/neirusalwa/mpr/tree/main/examples)

install :  
1. save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neirusalwa/mpr/main/MPR%2B.ini) file somewhere, make sure to change the file type to "all files (\*.\*)" otherwise it'll save as a .txt instead of .ini
2. move the file to your gshade preset folder, by default it should be in 
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\gshade-presets\Custom
```
3. in game, open gshade and navigate to "custom"

4. click on MPR+.ini like any other preset

5. ⚠ make sure to **untick** performance mode since this is a screenshot shader to avoid weird visual bugs ⚠

## SMSM
i recommend using the preset in conjunction with [smsm](https://github.com/s-ilent/smsm-ff14) to get nicer, more true to life (color wise) pictures. if you do use smsm however do note that DOF must be turned off in gpose itself, do all of ur DOF work on shaders ONLY otherwise you will get some weird artifacting around corners that is just due to how smsm works
